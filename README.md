# Unity Advanced First Person Movement System
As part of my personal project time during my research placement, I decided to try and recreate the advanced movement system from 'Titanfall 2'.
The system was built using the Unity game engine as it is the game engine I am most comfortable using. It was developed over a period of about 2 weeks.

# Functionality
The movement system was created using rigidbody physics rather than the unity character controller component as rigidbodies allow for more freedom with what movements the character can perform. 
The character is capable of basic movement capable of smooth movement across terrain, sprinting, crouching, crouch sliding when you crouch whilst sprinting, wall running and sliding down specific slopes.
